Random notes
============

The Makefile will concatenate all of these files into a single minified
.js file.

Here's a crash course on how things are organized.

models.js -- models registered with Ext.regModel()
templates.js -- Xtemplate
Coho-app.js -- The main web application
Coho-StoryPanel.js -- A story list > Story detail widget.
Common-panels.js -- Miscellaneous panels used in more than one place
Tab-*.js -- Top-level tabs (latest, popular, saved, etc.)
startup.js -- actual procedural code to boot the application
