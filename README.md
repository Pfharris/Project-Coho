## Running Project Coho locally

You can run the app by cloning the repository, running 'make,' and opening the index.html
in your local webserver (this part is important). You'll also need to view
the files in a Webkit browser. That's pretty much it. 

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug (well, um, _when_ you find a bug), please create an issue in the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/TheTyee/Project-Coho/issues).

## Helping to make the app better

If you're a fan of the Tyee and a whiz with JavaScript, please drop us a line. Better yet, just fork the repository, make changes, and send us a pull request with an explanation of the change. 

If you'd like to build an entirely different app, that's even better. In developing Project Coho, we've taken steps toward releasing a public API to The Tyee's data. Keep an eye on [api.thetyee.ca](http://api.thetyee.ca) over the coming weeks for more info. 

Enjoy.
